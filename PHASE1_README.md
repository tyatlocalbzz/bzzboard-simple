## 🗄️ Database Schema

The application includes comprehensive database models:

- **AdminUser**: Single admin authentication
- **Client**: Client information and brand assets
- **Shoot**: Shoot scheduling and tracking
- **ContentItem**: Ready-to-post content tracking
- **Post**: Social media post planning

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database
- Google Cloud Console project (for Calendar/Drive APIs)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
```bash
cd application
npm install
```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
Create `.env.local` with:
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/buzzboard"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Google APIs (for production)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
```

3. **Set up database:**
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

4. **Run development server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
